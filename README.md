## [Baby Name Exercise](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/baby-names)

## [Copy Special Exercise Modified](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/copy-special)

>Part A (manipulating file paths)
```
Gather a list of the absolute paths of the special files in all the directories. In the simplest case, just print that list (here the "." after the command is a single argument indicating the current directory). Print one absolute path per line.
```

>Part B (file copying)
```
If the "--todir dir" option is present at the start of the command line, do not print anything and instead copy the files to the given directory, creating it if necessary. Use the python module "shutil" for file copying.
```

>Part C (calling an external program)
```
If the "--tozip zipfile" option is present at the start of the command line, run this command: "zip -j zipfile <list all the files>". This will create a zipfile containing the files. Just for fun/reassurance, also print the command line you are going to do first (as shown in lecture). (Windows note: windows does not come with a program to produce standard .zip archives by default, but you can get download the free and open zip program from www.info-zip.org.)
```
> Tips:
```
You can reach the usage by performing the method --help
